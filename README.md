# Hi there, I'm Shivam!

I am an third-year undergraduate student at National Institute of Technology Meghalaya. <br>

I am a tech enthusiast and am proficient in backend development using Php and MySQL. I am fascinated by cloud computing and am learning more about Google Cloud and AWS.
Also, I am currently working in projects involving Javascript (APIs), and another involving Deep Learning.

It would be great to connect. Feel free to reach out:
